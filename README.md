# orbit-visual
Visualize orbital patterns using vectors. Originally created to support my Algebra II Honors Semester 2 Project.



## Purpose

Draws an orbital pattern based on values provided (the user is prompted when the program is run).



## Technologies Used

| Name   | Description                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Python | A scripting language. The project is written in this.        |
| Turtle | A graphics library that uses Tkinter. Used to draw the orbits incrementally. |



## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 2.x and Python 3.x both work)

2. If you are using Linux, run the following in your computer's terminal to install Tkinter (used for graphics):

   **Python 3:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

   **Python 2:**

   ```
   sudo apt-get install python-tk
   ```

3. To run the program, type the following in your computer's terminal/cmd/Powershell:

   ```
   python orbit.py
   ```

   If `python` cannot be found, make sure Python is added to your system's PATH. If Python is under a different environment variable, use that variable instead of `python` in the command above.
